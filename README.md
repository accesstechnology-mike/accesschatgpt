## Technical Details

- Built with Next.js for optimal performance
- Server-side content filtering
- Responsive design works on all devices
- Accessibility-first approach
- No cookies or tracking
- Session-based search history for navigation
- The core functionality of the search is handled by the `scrape-youtube` npm package. Integration is happening within the `app/api/search/route.js` Next.js API route.
  - *Historically the official YouTube Data API was used, however they reduced our quota to zero (with no warning) due to the accessible layout not meeting their design requirements. An appeal was made, but it was rejected.*
- The "strict" search functionality is achieved by setting the `PREF=f2=8000000` cookie in the request headers when using the `scrape-youtube` package.

### Implementation

- Multi-layer content filtering:
  - Server-side search term filtering checking against a SQLite database of inappropriate words
  - Automatic graceful redirect to homepage when bad words are detected
  - YouTube's Strict SafeSearch integration for video search results
- Caching strategy for popular searches to improve performance
- No client-side storage or tracking
